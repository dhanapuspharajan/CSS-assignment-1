    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <div class="first-list">
      <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,
          or in other media.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span id="css-is-not"><b>CSS is not neccessary</b></span>
          <span id="css-save-lot"> <b> CSS saves a lot of work</b></span> .It
          can control the layout of multiple web pages at once
        </li>
        <br />
        <li id="li-4">External Stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class="second-list">
      <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS
          files, However,
          <span id="however"
            ><b>in the tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span
          >, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
          yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p id="p1">
      When comparing CSS class and ID, the difference is that CSS class applies
      a style multiple elements,ID, on the other hand, applies a style to an
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL link
      to an element and its use in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p id="p3">
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
